# DEFIbot
Listens to twitter for tweets mentioning a specific hashtag and then transfers an Ardor asset according to some conditions

This bot is part of the DeFi (DeadFish) parody project. It has also been created to participate to the ardor hackathon https://ardor.tools/hackathon.html

All necessary information is contained in the code as comments.

For your own project, better to put assetID and node url as a variable at the beginning of the code. 
Consider this alpha version. :)
